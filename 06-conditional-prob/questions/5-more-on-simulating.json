    "question": "Researchers have developed a new blood test for patients in their 50s that can predict whether a patient will get Alzheimer's disease by age 75. The percentage of patients that will get Alzheimer's disease by age 75 is approximately 1%. Suppose the researchers believe their test will be approximately 60% accurate in identifying patients who will get Alzheimer's by age 75. Which of the following represents a reasonable number of patients that should be enrolled in the study to estimate the probability that a patient who will get Alzheimer's by age 75 will be identified by the test?",

        "correct": false,
        "feedback": "Incorrect. 1,000 patients would result in approximately 10 patients who develop Alzheimer's. It will be hard to identify whether the test was effective with such a small group of people who develop Alzheimer's."

        "answer": "20 to 200",

Even though the conditional probability of identifying Alzheimer's in people who will develop it by age 75 is large, we cannot use that conditional probability to choose the sample size. For example, even with 200 patients, the number of patients who will develop Alzheimer's will most likely be around 2."

        "answer": "200,000",
