The professor gives the students a Learning Catalytics assignment and finds that the EDGE students have a 90% chance of getting each problem correct, whereas the non-EDGE students have a 60% chance of getting each problem correct. If the professor picks an exam at random and checks the first question, what is the probability that it is from an EDGE student and is correct?",
