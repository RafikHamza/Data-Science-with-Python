    "\n",
    "\"Probability\" refers to mathematics for analyzing random phenomena. \n",
    "Chapter 4 of [*Foundations of Data Science with Python*](https://amzn.to/48PvKip) introduces the \n",
    "basics of probability, including:\n",
    "* defining terminology for random phenomena,\n",
    "* understanding relative frequency and its relation to probability,\n",
    "* defining what we mean by a \"fair experiment\" and how the probabilities of fair experiments can be analyzed,\n",
    "* defining Axiomatic Probability, which is the underlying approach used in modern Probability,\n",
    "* introducing Corollaries of the Axioms of Probability, as tools that facilitate calculating probabilities,\n",
    "* introducing Combinatorics, which is the mathematics of counting, and showing some examples of how Combinatorics is used in Probability,\n",
