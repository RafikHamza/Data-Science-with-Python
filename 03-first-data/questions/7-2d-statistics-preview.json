    "question": "A research wishes to assess the impact of Caribbean ocean surface temperature on the number of hurricanes that form in the North Atlantic Ocean. She partitions the data on the number of hurricanes for each month in the last 100 years based on whether the ocean surface temperature measurement was above or below the median temperature. She then conducts a NHST using the partition data sets. This should be considered:",
