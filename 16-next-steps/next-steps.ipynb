    "The next step for many readers of this book will be to learn about machine learning (ML) techniques.\n",
    "A good book to learn most of the basic concepts and techniques of ML is *Machine Learning:\n",

    "and techniques as of 2022, including attention and transformers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many ML techniques can be considered extensions of statistics techniques and thus\n",

    "techniques, I recommend *An Introduction to Statistical Learning\n",
    "with Applications in R* (2nd edition) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, \n",
    "and Robert Tibshirani, published by Springer, 2021 (ISBN 1071614177). Even better, a new version called\n",

    "thirteen weeks and covers many of the machine-learning models in `scikit-learn`. (It does not cover\n",

    "## Data Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this textbook, we have used a variety of plots, including scatter plots, histograms,line plots,  contour plots, and heatmaps.  However, there are many important topics in data visualization that could not be covered. \n",
    "These include principles for visualizing data and techniques for making visualizations attractive and effective at conveying a message. Many books address these topics from different aspects, but I will suggest one that I feel is most targeted toward data scientists and most usable as a follow-up text to the book you are reading. That book is *Fundamentals of Data Visualization: A Primer on Making Informative and Compelling Figures* by Claus Wilke, published by O'Reilly Media, 2019 (ISBN 1492031089). This book provides a series of chapters for visualizing different types of data but also includes a variety of topics that address important principles of data visualization. The code to generate the figures in the book is provided on the author's GitHub page in the R programming language at https://github.com/clauswilke/dataviz. However, code to create the visualizations in Python is also provided by Hoa Nguyen at https://github.com/hnguyentt/dataviz-python."
