    "question": "A nuclear engineer has put two samples of Uranium in identical containers. However, one is naturally occurring Uranium and the other is enriched Uranium. She wishes to perform measurements to determine which container has the enriched Uranium.<br> She uses a Geiger counter to detect the release of alpha particles from radioactive decay. Even enriched Uranium decays slowly, and during a 10 minute observation period, an alpha particle will be released with probability 1/6 if the sample is naturally occuring Uranium and with probability 1/2 if the sample is enriched Uranium. (Otherwise no alpha particle is released.)<br> Suppose a sample is chosen at random and observed over two separate 10-minute observation periods. If an alpha particle is detected in both observation periods, what is the probability that the sample is the enriched Uranium? Provide your answer to 3 significant digits.",
