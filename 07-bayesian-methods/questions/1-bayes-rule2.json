She wishes to perform measurements to determine which container has the enriched Uranium.<br> She uses a Geiger counter to detect the release of alpha particles from radioactive decay. Even enriched Uranium decays slowly, and during a 10 minute observation period, an alpha particle will be released with probability 1/6 if the sample is naturally occuring Uranium and with probability 1/2 if the sample is enriched Uranium. (Otherwise no alpha particle is released.)<br> Suppose a sample is chosen at random and observed over two separate 10-minute observation periods. If an alpha particle is detected in both observation periods, what is the probability that the sample is the enriched Uranium? Provide your answer to 3 significant digits.",
